AS7343 Threshold Channel Test
=============================

Part 1: Register Readback
Channel  Readback   Status
-------  --------   ------
0        0          PASS
1        1          PASS
2        2          PASS

5        5          PASS

Register readback: PASS

Part 2: Threshold Comparison (always CH0)

Calibration:
  NeoPixels OFF - Ch0: 8
  NeoPixels ON  - Ch0: 501
  Threshold: 172

Test A: NeoPixels ON (Ch0 > threshold)
  Cycles to AINT: 5 PASS
Test B: NeoPixels OFF (Ch0 < threshold)
  Cycles to AINT: 25 (timeout) PASS

Verification:
  a) Light ON triggers AINT:  PASS
  b) Light OFF no trigger:    PASS

Note: SP_TH_CH register r/w works but does NOT
      affect threshold comparison (always CH0)

Register readback: PASS
Hardware test:     PASS
RESULT: PASS
