AS7343 Persistence Test
=======================

Part 1: Register Readback
Value    Readback   Status
-----    --------   ------
0        0          PASS
1        1          PASS
2        2          PASS
3        3          PASS
4        4          PASS
5        5          PASS
6        6          PASS
7        7          PASS
8        8          PASS
9        9          PASS
10       10         PASS
11       11         PASS

13       13         PASS
14       14         PASS
15       15         PASS

Register readback: PASS

Part 2: Hardware Timing Verification

Calibration:
  NeoPixels OFF (FZ baseline): 11
  NeoPixels ON  (FZ peak):     650
  HIGH threshold (base+20%):   138

Counting Cycles to AINT:
Persistence  Cycles  Status
-----------  ------  ------
     1            1      PASS
     8           25      PASS

Verification:
  a) Persistence=1 triggers AINT:    PASS
  b) Persistence=8 triggers AINT:    PASS
  c) Higher persistence = more cycles (25 > 1): PASS

Register readback: PASS
Timing test:       PASS
RESULT: PASS
