AS7343 GPIO Test
================
Feedback pin: D3 connected to AS7343 GPIO

Part 1: Output Mode Test
  Output HIGH -> Pin reads: HIGH PASS
  Output LOW  -> Pin reads: LOW PASS

Part 2: Inversion Test
  Inverted + Value HIGH -> Pin: LOW PASS
  Inverted + Value LOW  -> Pin: HIGH PASS

Part 3: Input Mode Test
  Arduino drives HIGH -> AS7343 reads: HIGH PASS
  Arduino drives LOW  -> AS7343 reads: LOW PASS

Summary:
  Output mode:   PASS
  Inversion:     PASS
  Input mode:    PASS

RESULT: PASS
